# Seasonal codes

The function `const char *revk_season (time_t now)` is provided to return a string of seasonal codes. Applications make use of this for seasonal information, such as displays/doorbells.

The response is a set of codes that apply, but some applications just use the first letter. When multiple letters the first letter changes one the hour.

Applications show allow for new codes being added in the future, and for some changes to time ranges.|
